This is a quick tip for clearing Java cache on Linux.

It's simple. Just open the "**Java Control Panel**", to do this, type the command "**javaws -viewer**" in the terminal.

    $ javaws -viewer


Now just click the Settings button under "Temporary Internet Files" and delete the cache.

There are other Java configurations that can be performed in the **Java Control Center**, but I won't go into details here.
