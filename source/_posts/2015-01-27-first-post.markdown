I've always wanted to have my blog and publish things I want, especially in the IT area, since I've been working for some time as an Infrastructure Analyst, and I've been through a lot of things that would be interesting to share and also some things of personal interest and some hobbies, such as travel tips, sports, etc. ;-)
However, I was always annoyed having to create an infrastructure to publish anything simple, even a text.
I always had to set up a Wordpress instance, an Apache, etc. And it was even more work to write a post in a standardized and simple way.
That's when one day while researching some technologies I read something about Octopress. Before reading, I thought: Well, it must be another "Wordpress" or Wiki type. But I was wrong. I started reading some characteristics of Octopress and I already saw that the proposal was different, as it is a framework for generating static pages and with fantastic integration with Github, without the need to hire a VPS to host your blog.
How wonderful, I decided to test it. Well, I can say it's not a very simple configuration, it took me about two days to "understand" how it works and to make it work. But after it's ready, I can say: It's worth every minute lost in the configuration.
Now, in just a few minutes I generate a new post, version it, and best of all, in plain text, without HTML, Javascripts, Templates, etc...

As this is the first post and my environment is still in "Beta" phase, there is still a lot to improve.

I used CentOS 7 and Fedora 20 as Operating Systems and there are some "workarounds" to make Octopress work, and as soon as I get more familiar with it I will post explaining how to do the configuration.

See you soon!
