Just a tip for those who are starting to develop in Python. I recommend using the Atom Editor https://atom.io/.
It is a text editor developed by the folks at Github.

And after installing Atom, install the linter-pylama plugin: https://atom.io/packages/linter-pylama

With this plugin, it offers you several features and helps you develop following the PEP8 recommendations (Style Guide for Python Code)
